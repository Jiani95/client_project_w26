        <h2>Intro to Make Connections</h2>
        <p>
          Building connections with alumni is one of the most effective ways for
          students to explore career paths and secure jobs or internships.
          Networking consistently ranks as the top way opportunities are found,
          and alumni are often the most valuable contacts because they share a
          common educational background and are more inclined to help fellow
          students. Alumni can offer first-hand insight into specific industries
          and companies, provide honest perspectives on roles and career
          trajectories, and share practical advice on how to position yourself
          as a UMSI student to become more competitive and marketable. In fact,
          the number one career recommendation from the Career Development
          Office is to network with alumni, and that process often begins with a
          thoughtful email outreach.

        <h2>There are few steps for you to build your Connections</h2>
        <ul>

            <strong>First: Find Alumni</strong> UMSI CDO office has offered
            various ways and links for you to find Alumni
            <p>Those links would be helpful for you</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/2649/">UMSI Linkedin group</a>
                <p>
                  This is a Linkedin group which most UMSI alumni have joined. By
                  searching inside the group, you can easily find alumni and
                  communicate and chat with them.
                </p>

                <p>

                  career development resources website that's facing to UMSI student

              <li> <a href="https://umich.peoplegrove.com/v2"> UCAN</a>
                <p>
                  University career alumni network platform, this website allows you
                  catalyzing connections between students and professionals
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Second: Get a Response</strong> Send messages to your
            alumni, and don't get discouraged by low response rate - average
            response rate to “cold messages” is around 20%. Each contact you
            connect with is an important and valuable addition to your network!
            <p>
              We encourage you to schedule a coffee chat, phone call, or email
              conversation with alumni to build strong rapport through thoughtful
              outreach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are some DOs and DON'Ts to review before sending your first
              message
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong> DOs: </strong> Keep your message concise, time-bound,
                and personal: respect their time by proposing a clear time frame
                (e.g., a 20-minute coffee chat within two weeks) and showing
                genuine appreciation for them as an individual.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong> DON'Ts: </strong> Do not ask for information that is
                readily available online, avoid sending your résumé without
                permission, and never begin by requesting a referral or a job:
                focus on building a genuine relationship first.
              </p>
